At the heart of the Arc Agents framework is the Agent DSL.
The Arc Agents DSL is designed to provide a concise and elegant way to define AI powered Agents.
Arc Agents are a combination of LLM prompts, filters, external services and other resources, such as memory, to create
intelligent entities capable of handling complex tasks and/or conversations.

There are 2 ways to use the Arc Agent DSL:

- [Manual Setup](../manual_setup)
- [Spring Boot Beans](../spring/agent-beans)
