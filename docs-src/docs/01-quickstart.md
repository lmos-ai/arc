The fastest way to get started with Arc Agents is to clone the Spring Boot Init repository
and start the Spring Boot Application.
Refer : https://github.com/lmos-ai/arc-spring-init

This project can also be used a great starter for creating new Arc Agents Apps with Spring Boot. 

Simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.

More information on the Agent DSL [here](dsl/defining_agents).

:::info
Another way to get started quickly without an API-KEY, is to use ollama to run models locally.
For example, llama3. See [Llama3 is out!](/blog/Llama3)
